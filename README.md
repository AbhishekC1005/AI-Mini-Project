# Healthcare Decision Support System

An intelligent AI-powered healthcare assistant built with Google ADK that analyzes hospital data, calculates distances, and provides data-driven recommendations for resource allocation.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for data ingestion, analysis, and decision support
- **Hospital Data Analysis**: Track 40+ metrics including beds, ICU, ventilators, staff, supplies
- **Distance Calculations**: Real-time distance calculations between hospitals using coordinates
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Resources, staff, patient flow, supplies, equipment status
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Actionable recommendations based on actual hospital data

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Google API Key (for Gemini)
- OpenAI API Key (for embeddings)
- MongoDB Atlas account (for RAG - optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekC1005/Hospital-Management-AI-Agent.git
cd Hospital-Management-AI-Agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
MONGODB_DATABASE=rag_database
MONGODB_COLLECTION=documents
MONGODB_VECTOR_INDEX=vector_index
```

4. Run the agent:
```bash
adk web .
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Sample Data

The system includes sample data for 5 hospitals:
- City General Hospital (H001)
- Regional Medical Center (H002)
- Community Health Center (H003)
- Metropolitan Hospital (H004)
- District Hospital (H005)

Data covers 7 days (2024-10-20 to 2024-10-26) with comprehensive metrics.

## Example Queries

### Basic Information
```
"How many hospitals are there?"
"List all hospitals with their locations"
"What dates are available?"
```

### Detailed Analysis
```
"Show me details for City General Hospital on 2024-10-20"
"What is the bed occupancy for Regional Medical Center?"
"Calculate distance between City General Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital"
```

### Strategic Insights
```
"Recommend resource transfers between hospitals"
"What are the top priorities for today?"
"Show me hospitals with ventilator shortages"
```

## Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent architecture with three specialized agents:

1. **DataIngestionAgent**: Retrieves basic hospital information (counts, names, locations, date ranges)
2. **HospitalAnalyst**: Analyzes detailed metrics and calculates distances
3. **DecisionSupportAgent**: Provides strategic recommendations and insights

## Available Tools

### Hospital Data Tools
- `get_hospital_count()` - Total number of hospitals
- `get_hospital_names()` - List all hospitals with coordinates
- `get_hospital_details_by_date()` - Complete hospital snapshot
- `get_column_value()` - Specific metric values
- `get_column_names()` - Available data columns
- `get_hospital_location()` - Hospital coordinates
- `get_data_date_range()` - Available date range

### Distance Tools
- `calculate_distance_between_hospitals()` - Distance between two hospitals
- `get_all_hospital_distances()` - Distance matrix for all hospitals
